Home Court is a single page sports news app that can be used to search for real live news from hundreds of sources. Users can search for sports news based on city or state. Home Court provides image and description summaries with links and credits to the original articles. I engineered this app with a custom async query through News API and implemented the data through React.js. Technologies used include React.js and News API.
